                This Privacy Policy of Victory Gold spells out the obligations
                of the Users. This Privacy Policy is in continuation of the
                Terms of Service of Victory Gold Inc., therefore both documents
                need to be read together.</br></br> Victory Gold takes your privacy
                seriously. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
                disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service,
                and your choices about the collection and use of your
                information.</br></br> This privacy policy has been developed in
                compliance with Canada’s Personal Information Protection and
                Electronic Documents Act ("PIPEDA"). PIPEDA sets out rules for
                the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in
                the course of commercial activity as defined in the Act. Along
                with PIPEDA this privacy policy is also in compliance with
                Provincial Privacy Laws which are in addition to PIPEDA, such as
                British Columbia: Personal Information Protection Act; and
                Alberta: Personal Information Protection Act.</br></br> Victory Gold shall
                not (a) be subject to any obligations of confidentiality
                regarding any User Generated Content except as specified in
                Victory Gold’s Privacy Policy, or as otherwise specifically
                agreed to or required by law; (b) be obligated to pay you or any
                third party any compensation for any User Generated Content; and
                (c) be required to respond to any of your submissions as User
                Generated Content.</br></br> We reserve the right to amend our Privacy
                Policy from time to time and will update the Website with the
                most recent version. It is your responsibility to review this
                Privacy Policy to ensure that you are familiar with the most
                current provisions. If any changes are material, we may provide
                additional notice and/or opportunity to “opt-in” as appropriate.</br></br>
