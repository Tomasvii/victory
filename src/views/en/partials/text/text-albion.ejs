                            Albion Online uses two currencies for daily
                            transactions. Gold is the first used to purchase
                            premium statuses, items, repair equipment, upgrade
                            islands, and pay taxes and fees. Silver is the
                            second essential currency to buy and upgrade
                            buildings, territories and trade with NPCs.
                            <br /><br />

                            While silver can be acquired by completing quests
                            and killing monsters, gold must be purchased from
                            the in-game store. Gold is versatile as it can be
                            used between characters linked to the same account,
                            while silver cannot, meaning players must exchange
                            gold for silver and use it on whichever character
                            they want. Third-party merchants like Victory Gold
                            offer Albion Online silver and gold at affordable
                            prices, allowing players to skip the grind and boost
                            their progression with ease.

                            AAlbion Online is an MMORPG published in 2017 by
                            Sandbox Interactive, a German video game developer.
                            The game is set in a medieval era where players
                            develop their play styles according to the items and
                            skills they acquire. The game's economy is
                            completely player-driven, as players create
                            equipment and other items. To play Albion, players
                            had to pay for the game until 2019, when the game
                            switched to free-to-play mode with in-game
                            microtransactions.

                            Albion Online uses two currencies for daily
                            transactions. Gold is the first used to purchase
                            premium statuses, items, repair equipment, upgrade
                            islands, and pay taxes and fees. Silver is the
                            second essential currency to buy and upgrade
                            buildings, territories and trade with NPCs.
                            <br /><br />

                            While silver can be acquired by completing quests
                            and killing monsters, gold must be purchased from
                            the in-game store. Gold is versatile as it can be
                            used between characters linked to the same account,
                            while silver cannot, meaning players must exchange
                            gold for silver and use it on whichever character
                            they want. Third-party merchants like Victory Gold
                            offer Albion Online silver and gold at affordable
                            prices, allowing players to skip the grind and boost

                            Albion Online is an MMORPG published in 2017 by
                            Sandbox Interactive, a German video game developer.
                            The game is set in a medieval era where players
                            develop their play styles according to the items and
                            skills they acquire. The game's economy is
                            completely player-driven, as players create
                            equipment and other items. To play Albion, players
                            had to pay for the game until 2019, when the game
                            switched to free-to-play mode with in-game
                            microtransactions.
